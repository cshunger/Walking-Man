project
=======

This is a project that I made for my graphics class. I wrote a portion of the code but there was a portion of skeleton 
code. To run this project on a mac or linux open up a terminal and go to the directory it lies in, type:

make

./view3D walk.x3d

This should display a man walking through the woods with mountains (2D mountains) behind him.
